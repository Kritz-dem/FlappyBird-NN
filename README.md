# FlappyBird-NN

## Goals
This project's goal is to learn how neural networks work, and how genetic algorithms can be used to evolve these networks.
In addition I wanted to explore how rust's wasm performs with relatively heavy computation.

## Sources used:
   * Original Idea came from the youtube video : [A.I. Learns to play Flappy Bird](https://youtu.be/WSW-5m8lRMs)
   * Most of the rust code came from the tutorial [Learning to Fly: Let's simulate evolution in Rust!](https://pwy.io/en/posts/learning-to-fly-pt1/)
## Access the project
